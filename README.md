# Facundo's blog
This will be my personal blog.  
I write this website in order to practice use Next.js React framework. 

## Develop, Preview, Ship
We’ve just gone through the workflow we call **DPS**: **D**evelop, **P**review, and **S**hip.

* **Develop:** We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.  

* **Preview**: We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing code reviews, you can do deployment previews.  

* **Ship**: We’ve merged the pull request to main to ship to production.
