# Engineering itself
Any of the engineering careers have one point in common, they all use the basics sciences to build something that solves any sort of problem.
No matter the tool, the Engineer is capable of solve in a "high level" to just then, look for the tool, but the "big problem" just been solved.

That's why i chose this career, the ability of look the problem with a ***top-down*** approach is something that i will always love to learn, work and do.

## About the subjects itself  

### First year  

In the first year you will learn all about the basics of sciences as Mathematics, Algorithms and how use a Systems Engineering Approach to know all about the organization problem.  
This shows how to start to think more abstractly, and how to orginize all the incoming information.

I've passed 6 subjects, updating the total number from 2 to 8, those subjects are the following:  

*   Análisis Matemático 1  
*   Álgebra y Geometría Analítica  
*   Matemática Discreta  
*   Física 1  
*   Ingeniería y Sociedad  
*   Química  
*   Sistemas y Organizaciones  
*   Algoritmos y Estrucutras de Datos  


### Second year  
In the first year, you will learn how to identify and face up the ***Problem domain*** of some company (or organization itself) and model correctly all that information. You're going to see how the basics of sciences like **Mathematics** and **Organizations Theory** helps us in a lot of **day-to-day** problems to solve them in a more efficient way.  

These subjects are in progress, two of them are *quarterly*, after August I'm finishing them.  
Those subjects are the following:  

*   Análisis Matemático 2  
*   Arquitectura de los Computadores  
*   Análisis de Sistemas  
*   Sintaxis y Semántica de los Lenguajes  
*   Paradigmas de Programación  
*   Probabilidad y Estadísitca  


### Conclusion  

I love what i do, and i hope many people are encouraged to study this amazing career which give us, as society, a lot of capable professionals, so important when we have to make our lives easier.
