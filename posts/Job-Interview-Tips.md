# How to pass a coding interview  

In this article, i'm going to talk about some considerations that you must have when you finally get an interview.  

## Questions  
---
### Resume
During the conversation, maybe you'll be asked for your resume, more specifically, about your **projects section**.  
When this happen, you must be able to explain to everyone why are you using that technologies/framework/programming language and not some other.  
For example:  
*Why are you using MongoDB instead of MySQL databases?*  

### About yourself  
Yo should be able to describe your achievements, your interests (in related areas), and how you improved your skills during the Covid-19 pandemic, for example. Mentioning your learning time in any area could be a good idea as well.  

### Why do you want to work here?  
One of the keys to coming up with a compelling answer to this question is to flip the question, like this: "*Why would this company want to hire me?*"  
*   ***How can you help the company succeed?***  
What knowledge do i have that would be especially useful to this employer right now?  

*   ***What past career successes could you potentially repeat at this company?***  
In the past, how did you exceed your classmates? For example. What problem did you play a major role in solving? What lessons have you learned that you could apply in the future to create value for the potential employer?  

*   ***How will you complement the company's culture?***  
Do your homework on the company's culture and identify what you find most appealing about it.  

When you're asked, in an actual interview situation, you want to deliver your prepared answer in a way that sounds polished but natural. Consider using these templates:  

*   “*I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting/forward-thinking/fast-moving company/industry, and I feel I can do so by/with my …*”  

*   "*I feel my skills are particularly well-suited to this position because …*”  

*   "*I'm excited about this job opportunity, as it would allow me to …*"

### Why should we hire you?  
Like we said above, we want to show the employer why we are perfect for that position. In order to do that, you should focus on your learning skills, mentioning times to do that, your ability to read documentation and teach yourself.  
If they are looking for someone they can delegate without worries the *learning time*, **you are that person**.  

### Do you have any question for us?  
Is the best opportunity for you to know more about the company. 
*   *What type of technologies your team uses?*  
*   *Do i have an opportunity to contribute to open source if i choose to work for your company?*  
*   *I really enjoy teaching, will i have the chance to do that working with you at some point in the future?*
